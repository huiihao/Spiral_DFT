## Introduction

We share the **essential input files** for density functional theory (DFT) calculations as detailed in our paper [1]. The POSCAR for 1√ó1√óN PbTiO$_3$ , together with INCAR and KPOINTS, can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/huiihao/Spiral">GitHub repository</a>.

<!--The directory is organized as illustrated in the following diagram:

- The `train` directory houses both the training dataset and the `input.json` file which holds the training metadata.
- The `model` directory contains the force field file.
- The `DFT` directory provides a sample `INCAR` file used for DFT scf calculations during the training database construction. 
- Within the `test` directory:
  - The `NEB` directory contains necessary files that compare the DFT and DP energy barriers for various polarization switching pathways in ferroelectric hafnia. See **Section 4.1**.
  - The `Energy barriers` directory contains necessary files that compare the DFT and DP energy barriers for oxygen vacancy diffusion. See **Section 4.2**.
  - The `Piezoelectric` directory is for piezoelectric coefficient $d_{33}$ calculations using finite-field MD simulations. See **Section 4.3**.
  - The `Mobility` directory contains selected MD trajectories and python scripts for oyxgen ion mobility calculations. See **Section 4.4**.

This structure ensures clear categorization and easy navigation for users accessing the files.

The directory is organized as illustrated in the following diagram:

- `spiral`: Stores the analysis plots of the atomic structures for the 1√ó1√óN supercells.
- `data`: Contains subdirectories named according to the supercell dimensions. For example:
  - `sc1110`: Represents a 1√ó1√ó10 supercell. This directory also contains the corresponding `INCAR` and `KPOINTS` files.
  - `3.970`: A subdirectory within a folder like `sc1110`, representing an in-plane equiaxial lattice constant of 3.970 √Ö.
  - `STRUC_3`: A subdirectory within a folder like `3.970`, representing a distinct initial dipole spiral configuration. This setup is used to comprehensively search the configuration space for stable dipole spirals.
- `phono_band`: This directory contains the following subfolders for phonon band structure analysis:
  - `T`: Represents a conventional ferroelectric phase unit cell with polarization along the [001] direction when lattice is free. This folder contains the phonon band structure image (`freePTOphono.pdf`) and its corresponding raw data (`freePTOphono.yaml`).
  - `spiral_115`: Represents a 1√ó1√ó5 dipole spiral supercell when $a=b=3.970$ $\rm \AA$. This folder contains the phonon band structure image (`phono.pdf`) and its corresponding raw data (`phono.yaml` in `phono.zip`).

## Structural details of 1√ó1√óN supercells

We present here the supercell structures for N ranging from 4 to 16 under various in-plane equiaxial strains, all of which are stable and converged within the employed computational precision. For N=1, the structure consists of a simple, uniform polarization state. For N=2, the polarizations tend to stabilize in a parallel or antiparallel alignment. For N=3, the polarizations collectively occupy a single potential well, corresponding to the lowest-energy stable structure (i.e., the ground state), which is characteristic of the Rhombohedral (R) phase. For N=4, the four polarizations occupy four distinct equivalent potential wells, a configuration that is commensurate with the C4 symmetry of the lattice. For N ‚â• 5, we term these non-collinear dipole arrangements "dipole spirals."

## Talk about Phonon Spectrum

A key breakthrough is revealed in the calculated phonon spectrum: the symmetry of the X-S and S-Y paths about the S point. This feature directly reflects the unique symmetry of our dipole spiral structure in reciprocal space and provides dynamic confirmation of its distinctive physical properties.

**1. Overall Analysis: Dynamic Stability**

First, we observe that the phonon frequencies are positive (real) across the majority of the Brillouin zone, with the exception of some small imaginary frequencies near the Œì point. Such soft-mode imaginary frequencies at Œì are common in DFT calculations of complex structures and are typically related to numerical precision, residual stress, or numerical noise. Given that the imaginary frequencies are confined to a very small range (approximately within -1 cm‚Åª¬π) and the dispersion becomes positive away from the Œì point, we can conclude that the 1√ó1√ó5 dipole spiral structure is dynamically stable or metastable. This establishes the necessary prerequisite for discussing all of its physical properties.

**2. Core Discovery: X-S/S-Y Symmetry as a Dynamic Fingerprint of the Helical Order**

The most unusual and significant feature of this phonon spectrum is the symmetry observed between the X-S and S-Y paths. In a conventional [001]-oriented perovskite, which possesses either tetragonal or orthorhombic symmetry, the in-plane potential is four-fold or two-fold. Consequently, the phonon dispersion relations along the kx (e.g., Œì-X-S) and ky (e.g., Œì-Y-S) directions are generally different, meaning the X-S and S-Y paths would not be symmetric about the S point. In stark contrast, our calculated phonon spectrum clearly shows that the dispersion curve from X to S is a near-perfect mirror image of the curve from Y to S. This is a novel feature not seen in conventional perovskites.
